# Inkling Front End Designer Code Challenge

## Project Brief
Artemis Burger wants to turn their existing training content into a new webpage that their employees will be able to access on any device. Use the Word document attached to design and develop this new webpage for them, incorporating elements from the Artemis brand guidelines provided. You may also use any of the files in the assets folder in your new design. Please return a zipped HTML, CSS, and assets package for review.

## Resources Used
* Sketch
* Adobe Photoshop
* HTML
* CSS
* jQuery
* MaterializeCSS
* GitHub

## Design Process
After reviewing the project assets I did some sketching for discovery. I then brought my ideas into Sketch to test the concepts.

## Development Process
Designing mobile first is key to a successful responsive design. Once built out in code the browser window can gradually be expanded. Working this way reduces back-and-forth revisions between devices and keeps code in media queries minimal. To help manage my files and allow for version control I created a GitHub repository. Since the demo contains minified code, you'll probably want to have a look at the development files.

## Conclusion
I decided I wanted the check-list to be interactive, so I added check boxes for the user to keep track of tasks. Iconography helped call-out important details in the content. Once the project was completed I took the existing developer files and ran my code through a validator to make sure the syntax was solid. I then minified the code and compressed JPG images into an optimized "demo" version.
